# Shaiya Episode 6

An open-source effort to make episode 5 servers compatible with episode 6 clients.

## Environment

Windows 10

Visual Studio 2022

C++ 23

## Prerequisites

[Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)

[Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)

## Injection

Cheat Engine isn't guaranteed to work for everyone. It's not an issue with the application or the libraries. The libraries have an export defined in the main headers.

## Support

Older versions of the software are not supported. Send bug reports via email. Do not send images or videos unless you are asked to do so. Please provide steps to reproduce the issue(s), or I may not respond.

# Documentation

## Configuration

### Episode 5.4

```cpp
// shaiya/include/common.h
//#define SHAIYA_EP6_4_PT
```

### Episode 6.4

```cpp
// shaiya/include/common.h
#define SHAIYA_EP6_4_PT
```

## Libraries

The **shaiya** library contains common types and packet definitions. The other projects depend on this library.

https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/tree/main/shaiya

The **sdev-client** library is for build version `0x16021200` modifications. The DirectX SDK installer should create a system environment variable named `DXSDK_DIR` that specifies the installation directory.

https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/tree/main/sdev-client

https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/tree/main/sdev-client/bin

The **sdev-db** library is for the **dbAgent** service. It adds support for the character list packet and the name availability packet.

https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/tree/main/sdev-db

https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/tree/main/sdev-db/bin

https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/tree/main/sdev-db/bin/sql

The binary was patched to undo an edit that causes an item mall purchase dupe.

```
// bug
00407942  mov dword ptr [ebx+8],1

// original code
00407942  mov dword ptr [ebx+8],0
```

The **sdev-login** library is for the **login** service. It fixes a well-known bug (thanks, Cups) and parameterizes the login query. Use SQL Server Profiler to see the result.

```sql
declare @p1 int
set @p1=1
exec sp_prepexec @p1 output,N'@P1 text,@P2 text,@P3 bigint,@P4 text',N'EXEC usp_Try_GameLogin_Taiwan @P1,@P2,@P3,@P4','a','a',6998436556411240449,'127.0.0.1'
select @p1
```

https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/tree/main/sdev-login

https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/tree/main/sdev-login/bin

The **sdev** library is for the **game** service. Continue reading for more information.

## Item Mall

https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/tree/main/sdev-db/bin

https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/tree/main/sdev-db/bin/sql

Install the following procedures:

```
[dbo].[usp_Read_User_CashPoint_UsersMaster]
[dbo].[usp_Save_User_BuyPointItems2]
[dbo].[usp_Save_User_GiftPointItems2]
[dbo].[usp_Update_UserPoint]
```

If you receive an error, change `ALTER` to `CREATE` and try again.

# Features

## NpcQuest

The episode 6 format has 6 quest results, each containing up to 3 items. The following items are supported:

| ItemId    | SkillId    | SkillLv    |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| 101112    | 432        | 2          |
| 101113    | 432        | 3          |

The library will divide the ability value by 100. The exp value in the client result window comes from the data; not the packet. Please don't report it as a bug.

## Item Duration

https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/tree/main/sdev/bin/v2

https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/tree/main/sdev/bin/v2/sql

Warning: the **Items** script will create an empty table.

[ItemSqlWriter.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16039051/ItemSqlWriter.zip)

### Duration

The library expects the same day(s) to seconds conversion as the client.

| Days  | Duration    |
|-------|-------------|
| 1     | 86400       |
| 7     | 604800      |
| 15    | 1296000     |
| 30    | 2592000     |

Items **will not** be removed from guild warehouses. Items **will not** be deleted without sending a notification to the client. The client does not copy dates to items in the bank or guild warehouse.

### ExtDuration

| 0      | None            |
| 1      | Unexpandable    |
| 2      | Expandable      |

## Revenge Mark

The kill count will determine which effect(s) will be rendered. The library will increment the kill count until 999.

| KillCount         | EffectName                   | EffectDataId    |
|-------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| 1                 | RevengeMark_Loop_01.EFT      | 265             |     
| 2                 | RevengeMark_Loop_02.EFT      | 266             |
| 3                 | RevengeMark_Loop_03.EFT      | 267             |
| 4                 | RevengeMark_Loop_04.EFT      | 268             |
| 5                 | RevengeMark_Loop_05.EFT      | 269             |
| 6                 | RevengeMark_Loop_06.EFT      | 270             |
| 7                 | RevengeMark_Loop_07.EFT      | 271             |
| 8-999             | RevengeMark_Loop_08.EFT      | 272             |
| odd               | RevengeMark_Notice_01.EFT    | 262             |
| even              | RevengeMark_Notice_02.EFT    | 263             |
| 999               | RevengeMark_Notice_03.EFT    | 264             |

The **sdev-client** library adds support for system message 509.

```
508    "Your revenge to <t> has succeeded!"
509    "<t> killed  you <v> time(s)."
```

### Money

The gold per percentage value in the library is the same as the official server.

```cpp
constexpr auto gold_per_percentage = 100'000'000;
```

### Crafting Hammers

The **ReqVg** value is the success rate. The library will multiply the value by 100.

| ItemId    | Effect    | ReqVg    |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| 102074    | 102       | 5        |
| 102075    | 102       | 10       |

### Free Combination

This feature will not be implemented.

## Synergy

The library expects **SetItem.SData** to be in the **PSM_Client/Bin/Data** directory.

### Client Format

The client expects the file to be encrypted.

![Capture2](https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/assets/142125482/01b93010-05a5-4323-b8d5-e890551ed4b7)

#### Bonus Description

`" Sinergia [5]\n- LUC +20\n- DEX +50\n- STR +70"`


### Server Format

The library expects the file to be decrypted. The bonus text is expected to be 12 comma-separated values.

![Capture](https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/assets/142125482/a0a0c116-c5a0-4443-953e-35077e29f065)

The values are signed 32-bit integers, expected to be in the following order:

* strength
* dexterity
* intelligence
* wisdom
* reaction
* luck
* health
* mana
* stamina
* attackPower
* rangedAttackPower
* magicPower

## Item Ability Transfer

Use item `101150` to activate the window. The `CraftName` and `Gems` will be removed from the original item if the transfer is successful.

| ItemId    | Effect    |
|-----------|-----------|
| 101150    | 105       |

### Success Rate

The base success rate is 30 percent.

| ItemId    | Effect    | ReqVg    | Success Rate    |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| 101156    | 106       | 20       | 50              |
| 101157    | 106       | 50       | 80              |
| 101158    | 106       | 60       | 90              |

| 0x16032100    | PT           | No           |

## Perfect Lapisian Cube

Use item 101101 to activate the window. See system message 510 for more information.

## Safety Enchant Scroll
